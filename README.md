# kaaosgit

Some personal projects with slight bias towards spatial data processing.
I use (/try to learn) mostly Python, C, Java, R and SQL.

I'm a perfectionist by nature and love details and simple functionality, 
but that doesn't mean you're not going to hit any errors in my code - use cautiously!
