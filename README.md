# kaaosgit 

#kaaosgit serves as my public repository. Currently it only contains some small scripts tools. 
Larger projects are now, unfortunately, moved to private repositories for more in-depth development.

Languages I like most (at the time) are C, Python, Java, R and SQL. This repository contains mostly Python scripts.

I'm a perfectionist by nature and love details and simple functionality, 
but that doesn't mean you're not going to hit any errors in my code!
